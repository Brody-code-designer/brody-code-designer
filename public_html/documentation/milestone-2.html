	<p>This will be a GIF or an image in the background of the first section of my Webpage. It will be either a single image of code or it will be GIF of code with a website being snapped into existence. Depending on how the GIF comes out will determine which I will choose.</p>
	<h3>My Value/About Me</h3>
	<p>This section is going to sell my service as reliable and affordable. I want the client to understand that they can trust me with their web development needs. To do this I am going to cite my ability to code websites from the ground up and ability to do unique design work. Lastly I want the customer to feel like after reading this section that they will have a personal relationship with me while their website is being built. I'm going to do this by offering one-on-one service times for me and the client to get together digitally to discuss exactly it is that they might want on their website. In general I want the customer to feel like I can further their goals with my service.</p>
	<!--<ul>

	</ul>-->
	<h3>Side bar</h3>
	<p>I want to create a sidebar with a couple options. This sidebar will designed using Parallax. It will stay on the screen as the user scrolls down the page. It will have a button that easily gets the customer to take the next steps on contacting me or learning more about me. It will have a phone icon, GitHub icon, link to my personal portfolio, linkedIn and more. In mobile view it will be static next to about me.</p>
	<h3>Web Development Services</h3>
	<p>Here I am going to have three web development services that I will provide. The first is going to be a basic website package. It is going to list the number of pages I will create and the ability for the site to be responsive to mobile devices. The second will be to develop a WordPress website. Here I will provide the option for a customer to see some of the features they will get with a basic WordPress website. In addition, will be an optional service for me to maintain their WordPress website. The last service will be a custom contract that me and the client will create together. Some benefits here will be the ability to create a more complex website or WordPress website with an online shop. Overall this section will provide customers an opportunity to get an idea of what services I provide.</p>
	<!--<ul>
		<li>responsive mobile websites</li>

			like.

	<h3>Client Reviews</h3>

	<h3>Contact Form and contact Info-phone number -email -github </h3>
	<p>This section will be the basic contact form</p>

	<h3>Footer</h3>
