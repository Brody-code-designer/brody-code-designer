            <h3>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h3>
            <p><em>Purpose:</em>The purpose of my PWP will be to help me get some freelance work. My plan is to start my career, as a Web Developer, doing freelance work. This website I create will be a way for people to find me and hire me as their Web developer.</p>
            <p><em>Audience:</em>My audience is going to be narrow in scope. This is intended to give me the best shot at appealing to them in particular. This audience is going to be professional YouTuber's in the market for a certified Web Developer. To make it even more narrower I plan to target particularly gamers and vloggers who want a website to sell their merch. I've chosen this audience because I have personal experience with people who do this work. Lastly there appears to be opportunities with this audience as it is clear that the online entertainment industry is exponentially growing.</p>
            <p><em>Goal:</em>My goal with the PWP is to create a site that will put me in the position to get freelance work after graduation. This site will be used as a place for Youtubers to check out if I am the right person to create their websites. When my website is completed it will be the place where my potential customers are directed for more information. This is essential because I plan to advertise myself when I am ready for the job. This website will be the key to finding some of my first freelancing work.</p>
